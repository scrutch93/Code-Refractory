# Code-Refractory

This assignment required the developer to make some revisions to some code of a website for a company that explained the importance of having an online presence. The goal was to have the code edited to become more appropriate semantically.

The source originally contained a lot of division tags. The majority of these tags were changed to better define the layout of the code. The site was also given a title name to reflect in the browser tab.

All images in the html were given alternative desccriptions to allow a handicapped user to better understand what is meant to be displayed on the site.

The footer was originally set as a class. I decided to change to an actual footer as it seemed more appropriate.

The css file was consolidated as originally there were several attributes and elements that seemed redundant. Also, changes to the css file had to be made once certain tags were altered in the html. Final submission  reflected a more compact structure while keeping the integrity of the site.
